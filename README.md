## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- cookie-session
- - note: body-parser was deprecated because Express has the same functionality now, so I used the express method instead

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Functionality

- Create short URL links and save them to your account
- Edit and delete links
- Track the number of times your url has been clicked on, how many unique clicks, and list the visitor ids and timestamps for each click.
